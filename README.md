# Tic Tac Toe Solo Project #

## Project Description ##

This was a solo project assigned to test the depth of our knowledge and skill by the end of mod1. We were tasked with creating a fully functional tic tac toe game from scratch.
The two players should be able to click the space of their choice and have the board be updated with their assigned player token.
Wins are recorded and saved, as in persist upon refresh, and different messages pop up on the page based on turn, who wins, and if there is a draw.
When a game concludes, either by win or draw, the board resets after a a set time down.
